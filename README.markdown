A small tool to help me overcome the increasing suckyness in [Campfire](http://www.campfirenow.com).

My goal is to have a separate program that lets you just chat without keeping browser windows open.

To use it, create your own **settings.config** file by using settings.config.example as a starting point. Make sure you get your username, password and campfire URL right.
